# Vehicule_detection_using_YoloV5

This data science project aims to create a vehicule detection and tracking application. The realization of this project is divided into different steps: 

- Train yolov5 on a custom dataset from kaggle.com and convert the model to a tflite model.
- Build an Android app that uses the tflite model to detect and track vehicules in real time
